# Invoice-Extraction-Detection
Invoice Extraction and Detection is an OCR-based web system developed during a summer internship to extract structured data from invoice images. It uses OpenCV preprocessing with Tesseract and EasyOCR, a Flask backend, and a React UI to generate CSV and PDF outputs across diverse invoice formats.

This project processes invoice images (JPG, PNG) and extracts key fields such as item names, quantities, prices, and totals. It supports invoices of varying layouts, including daily retail and grocery bills, and outputs structured data in CSV and PDF formats.

The backend extraction pipeline is fully functional and reliable. Some frontend visual mappings may require further refinement for consistent value rendering across all invoice formats.
